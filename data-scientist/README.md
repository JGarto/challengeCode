# Data Scientist Application Assignment

Inside `data`, you will find a number of CSV files, which contain data from [Kaggle][1], originally pulled from
[Goodreads][2].

## Data tips

### `books.csv`

Book metadata.

`best_book_id` is the most popular edition for a given work. Generally it's the same as `goodreads_book_id`, differs
occasionally.

`books_count` is the number of editions for a given work.

## Questions

### Question 1

Describe a commercial project in which you set up and analysed tracking data. What actions came out of this work?

## Question 2

Use any approach you feel comfortable with, but include any scripts with your answer and make sure your working is
clear.

What thoughts do you have on the results?

### Question 3

Again, you  may use any tools; include scripts and clear workings in your answer.
