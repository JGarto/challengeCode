# Data Scientist Assignment

## Question 1

Describe a commercial project in which you set up and analysed tracking data.
What actions came out of this work?

## Question 2

Imagine a product with three basic components:
* Public app with client-facing landing pages
* Internal SPA app for registered users
* Mobile app for a side project (sharing only part of the users)

Users can browse pages, search & buy products using the interal app and
apply for other services using mobile app.

Design an event-based, tracking system which would aggregate and visualize
collected events.

Assuming that existing product has lots of different storage solutions, what
will be the source of truth for the tracking system? How about the data
from time before events were collected?

What tools and solutions would you use? Ideally, implement part of it.

## Question 3

Assuming that both anonymous and authenticated users are going to
browse the apps on different devices; how would you solve the problem
of tracking and reconciling events sent before user was known?

## Question 4

There's number of reports with tables and charts to be done each week. What tools
are you going to use to automate this process and visualise your own statistics?
